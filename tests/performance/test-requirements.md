# Performance Testing Requirements Validation

This document outlines how to test that all performance testing requirements are working as expected.

## 1. Setup Script Validation

### Test: Basic Setup Functionality
```bash
# Test syntax validation
bash -n setup.sh

# Test full setup execution
./setup.sh
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ All prerequisites checked
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Directories created
- ✅ Configuration files validated
- ✅ Clear usage instructions displayed

## 2. Configuration Validation

### Test: Performance Budgets Configuration
```bash
# Test valid configuration
node -e "console.log('Valid:', JSON.stringify(require('./performance-budgets.json'), null, 2))"

# Test invalid configuration (create temporary invalid file)
echo '{"invalid": json}' > temp-invalid.json
node -e "require('./temp-invalid.json')" 2>&1 || echo "Correctly caught invalid JSON"
rm temp-invalid.json
```

### Test: Artillery Configuration
```bash
# Verify artillery.yml exists and is readable
cat artillery.yml | head -10

# Test with simple configuration
cat simple-test.yml | head -10
```

## 3. Baseline Testing System

### Test: First Run (No Baseline)
```bash
# Run baseline test with working endpoint
node baseline-test.js simple-test.yml
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Test executes successfully
- ✅ Shows "FAIL" for baseline (no previous baseline found)
- ✅ Shows "PASS" for budget validation
- ✅ Creates new baseline file in baselines/ directory
- ✅ Generates report in reports/ directory

### Test: Subsequent Run (With Baseline)
```bash
# Run again to test baseline comparison
node baseline-test.js simple-test.yml
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Test executes successfully
- ✅ Shows baseline comparison results
- ✅ Shows budget validation results
- ✅ Updates baseline if performance improved

## 4. Error Detection and Handling

### Test: API Endpoint Issues
```bash
# Test with problematic endpoint (405 errors)
node baseline-test.js artillery.yml
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Detects HTTP 405 errors
- ✅ Reports failed requests
- ✅ Shows budget violations if applicable
- ✅ Generates detailed error report

### Test: Server Unavailable
```bash
# Stop backend server temporarily and test
# (This would require manual server shutdown)
node baseline-test.js simple-test.yml
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Detects connection failures
- ✅ Reports appropriate error messages
- ✅ Fails gracefully without crashing

## 5. Budget Validation

### Test: Budget Compliance
```bash
# Test with lenient budgets (should pass)
node baseline-test.js simple-test.yml
```

### Test: Budget Violations
```bash
# Modify performance-budgets.json to have very strict limits
# Then run test to verify budget violation detection
```

## 6. Reporting System

### Test: Report Generation
```bash
# Check that reports are generated
ls -la reports/

# Verify report content
cat reports/performance-report-*.json | jq '.summary'
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Reports directory contains timestamped files
- ✅ JSON reports contain all required fields
- ✅ Reports include performance metrics
- ✅ Reports include budget validation results
- ✅ Reports include baseline comparison (when applicable)

## 7. Integration Testing

### Test: Full Workflow
```bash
# Clean previous results
npm run clean

# Run complete test suite
npm test

# Verify all components work together
ls -la baselines/ reports/ results/
```

## 8. NPM Scripts Validation

### Test: All NPM Commands
```bash
# Test each npm script
npm test
npm run test:baseline
npm run test:quiet
npm run clean
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All scripts execute without errors
- ✅ Appropriate output for each script type
- ✅ Clean script removes generated files

## 9. HIPAA Compliance Verification

### Test: Data Handling
```bash
# Verify no real patient data in test files
grep -r "patient\|medical\|health" artillery.yml simple-test.yml

# Check that only synthetic data is used
cat artillery.yml | grep -A 5 -B 5 "payload"
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No real patient data in configurations
- ✅ Only synthetic/test data used
- ✅ No sensitive information logged

## 10. Performance Metrics Validation

### Test: Metrics Collection
```bash
# Run test and verify metrics are collected
node baseline-test.js simple-test.yml
cat reports/performance-report-*.json | jq '.metrics'
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Response time metrics collected
- ✅ Throughput metrics available
- ✅ Error rate calculations
- ✅ Success rate measurements

## Automated Test Suite

To run all tests automatically:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create comprehensive test script
echo "Running Performance Testing Requirements Validation..."

# Test 1: Setup Script
echo "1. Testing setup script..."
bash -n setup.sh && echo "✅ Setup script syntax valid" || echo "❌ Setup script has syntax errors"

# Test 2: Configuration Validation
echo "2. Testing configuration validation..."
node -e "require('./performance-budgets.json')" && echo "✅ Performance budgets valid" || echo "❌ Performance budgets invalid"

# Test 3: Baseline System
echo "3. Testing baseline system..."
node baseline-test.js simple-test.yml > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "✅ Baseline system working" || echo "❌ Baseline system failed"

# Test 4: Report Generation
echo "4. Testing report generation..."
[ -f "reports/performance-report-"*.json ] && echo "✅ Reports generated" || echo "❌ No reports found"

# Test 5: NPM Scripts
echo "5. Testing NPM scripts..."
npm run clean > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "✅ NPM scripts working" || echo "❌ NPM scripts failed"

echo "Requirements validation complete!"
```

## Success Criteria

All requirements are working correctly when:

1. ✅ Setup script runs without errors
2. ✅ Configuration files are properly validated
3. ✅ Baseline system creates and compares baselines
4. ✅ Budget validation detects violations
5. ✅ Error detection identifies API issues
6. ✅ Reports are generated with complete data
7. ✅ NPM scripts execute successfully
8. ✅ HIPAA compliance maintained
9. ✅ Performance metrics are accurately collected
10. ✅ System handles both success and failure scenarios gracefully
