# Mental Health PMS Backup Policy

## Overview

This document defines the backup and recovery policy for the Mental Health Practice Management System (PMS) to ensure HIPAA compliance, data protection, and business continuity.

## Policy Statement

The Mental Health PMS maintains comprehensive backup and recovery procedures to protect Protected Health Information (PHI) and ensure system availability. All backups are encrypted, securely stored, and regularly tested to meet HIPAA requirements and industry best practices.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- PostgreSQL database containing PHI and application data
- Application configuration and secrets
- System logs and audit trails
- Infrastructure configurations

## Backup Requirements

### 1. Data Classification

#### Critical Data (RPO: 1 hour, RTO: 4 hours)
- Patient records and PHI
- Clinical notes and assessments
- Billing and insurance information
- User authentication data
- Audit logs

#### Important Data (RPO: 24 hours, RTO: 8 hours)
- Application configurations
- System settings
- Non-PHI operational data

#### Standard Data (RPO: 7 days, RTO: 24 hours)
- System logs (non-audit)
- Performance metrics
- Development/testing data

### 2. Backup Types

- Verify archive integrity
- Test PostgreSQL structure
- Validate PITR capability
- Generate verification report

### 3. Alerting

#### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Backup failure
- Encryption key unavailable
- S3 access denied
- Backup age exceeds threshold

#### Warning Alerts (4-hour Response)

- Storage quota approaching limit
- Verification test failure
- Old backup cleanup issues

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Recovery Types

#### Full Database Restore
- **Use Case**: Complete database corruption or loss
- **RTO**: 4 hours
- **Process**: Restore from latest base backup

#### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- **Use Case**: Data corruption at specific time
- **RTO**: 6 hours
- **Process**: Restore base backup + replay WAL to target time

#### Partial Recovery
- **Use Case**: Specific table or data corruption
- **RTO**: 2 hours
- **Process**: Extract specific data from backup

### 2. Recovery Process

```bash
# Standard recovery procedure
1. Assessment and preparation
