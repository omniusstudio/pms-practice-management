# Changelog

All notable changes to the PMS (Practice Management System) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Automated semantic versioning and release management
- HIPAA-compliant release notes generation
- Conventional commit validation
- Automated changelog generation
- Release artifact creation and management

## Previous Releases

> **Note:** This changelog was introduced with the implementation of semantic versioning.
> Previous releases used date-based versioning (YYYY.MM.DD.HHMMSS format).
> For historical release information, please refer to the deployment logs in AWS SSM Parameter Store.

### Migration from Date-Based Versioning

The system previously used date-based versioning with the format `YYYY.MM.DD.HHMMSS`.
Starting with this release, we've migrated to semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to provide:

- **Better change communication**: Clear indication of breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes
- **Automated release management**: Streamlined release process with conventional commits
- **HIPAA compliance**: Automated sanitization of sensitive information in release notes
- **Improved rollback capabilities**: Enhanced version tracking for safer deployments

### Versioning Guidelines

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version: Incompatible API changes or breaking changes
- **MINOR** version: New functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version: Backwards compatible bug fixes

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add multi-factor authentication support
fix(api): resolve patient data validation error
docs: update API documentation for v2 endpoints
chore(deps): update security dependencies
```

### HIPAA Compliance

All release notes and changelogs are automatically sanitized to ensure HIPAA compliance:

- Patient identifiers are redacted
- Personal information is removed
- API keys and tokens are sanitized
- Internal system references are anonymized
- Database connection strings are redacted

### Release Process

1. **Development**: Create feature branches with conventional commit messages
2. **Pull Request**: Submit PR with conventional commit title
3. **Review**: Code review and automated quality checks
4. **Merge**: Merge to main branch triggers release workflow
5. **Release**: Automated semantic release creates version and changelog
6. **Deploy**: CD pipeline deploys to staging, then production with approval

### Support
