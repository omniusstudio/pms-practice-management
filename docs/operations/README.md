## Quick Start Guide

### Feature Flag Operations

1. **Before Starting**: Always run the rollback tests first
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-feature-flag-rollback.py --verbose
   ```

2. **Check Current Status**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/manage-feature-flags.sh status
   ```

3. **Enable a Feature** (with monitoring):
   ```bash
   # Start monitoring in background
   ./scripts/monitor-feature-rollout.sh -f feature_name -d 600 &
   
   # Enable the feature
   ./scripts/manage-feature-flags.sh enable feature_name
   ```

4. **Emergency Rollback**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/manage-feature-flags.sh disable feature_name
   ```

5. **View Audit Trail**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/manage-feature-flags.sh audit
   ```

### Best Practices

1. **Always test rollback procedures** before production rollouts
2. **Use gradual rollouts** for user-facing features
3. **Monitor continuously** during rollouts
4. **Maintain audit trails** for all changes
5. **Follow the communication templates** for stakeholder updates
6. **Keep rollback procedures simple** and well-tested

### Emergency Procedures

In case of critical issues during a feature rollout:

1. **Immediate Action**: Disable the feature flag
   ```bash
   ./scripts/manage-feature-flags.sh disable FEATURE_NAME
   ```

2. **Assess Impact**: Check monitoring dashboards and logs

3. **Communicate**: Use the emergency notification template from the playbook

4. **Document**: Record the incident and lessons learned

## Support and Troubleshooting

For issues with operational procedures:

1. **Check the troubleshooting section** in the relevant playbook
2. **Review recent audit logs** for configuration changes
3. **Validate system prerequisites** (kubectl, database access, etc.)
4. **Contact the on-call engineer** for urgent issues

## Contributing

When updating operational procedures:

1. **Test all changes** in staging environment first
2. **Update associated scripts** if procedures change
3. **Review with the operations team** before merging
4. **Update version numbers** and review dates
5. **Follow the standard PR process** defined in `docs/dev-workflow.md`

## Compliance Notes

All operational procedures in this directory are designed to maintain:

- **HIPAA Compliance**: Audit trails, access controls, data protection
- **SOC 2 Requirements**: Change management, monitoring, incident response
- **Security Best Practices**: Least privilege, secure communications, encryption

Ensure all team members are trained on these procedures and understand their compliance implications.
