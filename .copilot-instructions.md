## Copilot Instructions

This project follows a strict HIPAA-compliant workflow.

When contributing code:
- Use `./scripts/init-feature.sh` to start a new feature branch
- Do **not** commit directly to `main`
- Follow `docs/dev-workflow.md` for PR and release instructions
- Always confirm with the user if something is unclear
