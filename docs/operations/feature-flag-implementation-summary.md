  - Monitoring, alerting, and compliance guidelines
  - Emergency procedures and communication templates

- **Operations README**: `docs/operations/README.md`
  - Quick start guide for feature flag operations
  - Best practices and emergency procedures
  - File structure and compliance notes

### 2. Automation Scripts

#### Management Script: `scripts/manage-feature-flags.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Status checking with visual indicators
  - Enable/disable feature flags
  - List all available flags
  - Configuration validation
  - Backup and restore functionality
  - Audit trail logging
  - Support for both Kubernetes and local development

#### Monitoring Script: `scripts/monitor-feature-rollout.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time monitoring during rollouts
  - Automatic alerting on threshold breaches
  - Metrics collection (error rate, response time, resource usage)
  - Comprehensive reporting
  - Integration with webhook notifications

#### Testing Script: `scripts/test-feature-flag-rollback.py`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive rollback procedure testing
  - Configuration validation tests
  - Management script functionality tests
  - Backup/restore procedure validation
  - Performance and audit logging tests
  - Detailed test reporting

### 3. Makefile Integration

Added feature flag management targets to the main Makefile:

```bash
# Feature Flag Management Commands
make ff-status          # Show current feature flag status
make ff-enable FLAG=x   # Enable a feature flag
make ff-disable FLAG=x  # Disable a feature flag
make ff-list           # List all available feature flags
make ff-validate       # Validate feature flag configuration
make ff-backup         # Backup current configuration
make ff-audit          # Show audit trail
make ff-test-rollback  # Test rollback procedures
make ff-monitor FLAG=x # Monitor feature rollout
```

## Key Features

### 1. Environment Support
- **Local Development**: Works with local JSON configuration files
- **Kubernetes**: Integrates with ConfigMaps for production environments
- **Automatic Detection**: Seamlessly switches between modes

### 2. Safety and Compliance
- **Audit Logging**: All changes are logged with timestamps and user information
- **Backup/Restore**: Automatic backup before changes, easy restore procedures
- **Validation**: Configuration validation before applying changes
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring with automatic alerting

### 3. Developer Experience
- **Simple Commands**: Easy-to-use Makefile targets
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated testing of all procedures
- **Documentation**: Clear procedures and troubleshooting guides

## Usage Examples

### Basic Operations
```bash
# Check current status
make ff-status

# Enable a feature flag
make ff-enable FLAG=telehealth_appointments_enabled

# Monitor the rollout
make ff-monitor FLAG=telehealth_appointments_enabled DURATION=600

# Create a backup before major changes
make ff-backup

# Test rollback procedures
make ff-test-rollback
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Quick disable of problematic feature
make ff-disable FLAG=problematic_feature

# Verify the change
make ff-status

# Check audit trail
make ff-audit
```

## Testing Results

### Automated Test Suite
- ✅ **Configuration Validation**: All tests passed
- ✅ **Flag Toggle Operations**: All tests passed
- ✅ **Management Script Functions**: All tests passed
- ✅ **Monitoring Script Functions**: All tests passed
- ✅ **Backup/Restore Procedures**: All tests passed
